# Challenges To Conquer
1. Need to get user feedback, get the search term text in a searchbar
2. Once search term is retrieved, make a request to external API and fetch data
3. Taking list of images and rendering list on screen

## What Components To Create
- [x] App Component, as always
  - Parent for and renders SearchBar and ImageList

- [] Create SearchBar component
  - responsible of showing only text input at top of screen
  - handle typing event

- [] ImageList Component
  - take list of images and render it on the screen

- I'll probably have a few different components in this app
- These components will also have respective CSS files for styling, at some point
- Create structure for `components`, `apis` and maybe `css` folders
