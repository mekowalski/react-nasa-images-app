# React Nasa Images App

This is for diving deeper into React, including topics of: User Input with Forms and Events

Kowalski, are you there?

## App Summary
- In this NASA Images Application I continued practicing handling user input with Froms and Events
- External API from NASA Images API, root url: `https://images-api.nasa.gov`
- This connection returns images, with params of `q(query)` & `media_type('image')`, given a search term
  - eg: saturn returns images related to saturn
